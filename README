SqPy uses a standard generate and test approach to pack
connected groups of spheres into a cubic close packed
square pyramid.

LonPos (lonpos.com.au) Pyramid (eg 101) uses a 5 deep 
pyramid and a specific set of flat sphere groups.

SqPy finds LonPos pyramid solutions but support user
specified sphere groups and pyramid size.
